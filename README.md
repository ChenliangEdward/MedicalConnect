### Branch Strategy
- This repo is consisted with 3 branches: main, dev, test.
- **main**: The most stable and tested version, will only be updated when fully tested and is always functional. 
- **dev**: This branch will be used to update any minor changes and modifications in the process of development. When complete we will merge it to the test branch.
- **test**: This branch is used to test the product developed from the dev branch. When it is fully tested it will be merged to the main branch.  

### Implementation
We will be using **Python Flask** to build servers and hand quewries from clients. We will be using **SQLalchemy** as our database manager.
